        <p>

        All results are based on a sample of about XXXX Flemish individuals from the EU
        Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC). The results of the total
        Flemish population are expected to go in the same direction, but are susceptible
        to some differences due to under-representation of some individuals at the upper
        or lower tail of the distribution. Furthermore, the EU-SILC survey contains
        incomplete fiscal information (for instance, municipal taxes, but also many
        deductible expenses , are not included in the model).

        </p>
        <p>

        Since Mefisto is an arithmetic model, no behavioral reactions are included.
        Please be aware that agents in the model do not change their economic behavior
        such as their labor supply, their expenditure behaviour or demographic status
        (being married or not, having children or not) due to the implemented policy
        changes. If available, detailed analyses of policy changes including behavioral
        reactions can be found on www.flemosi.be

        </p>
        <p>

        The impact of the policy changes is measured on the basis of individual
        disposable income. The household composition is taken into account in the
        standard way, which is by using OECD equivalence scales. Equivalized disposable
        incomes are divided equally among all members of the household, ignoring within
        household inequality.

        Individuals are classified in deciles according to their disposable equivalized
        income before the reform. The average impact of the reform for a given decile is
        presented in Euros per month. A more detailed analysis according to other
        classifications can be obtained by clicking on 'more'.

        The budgetary impacts are presented in millions of Euros per year. A more

        The poverty line for a single is fixed at 60% of the median, which is about 960
        euro a month. The poverty rate measures the percentage of Flemish individuals
        below this threshold. The total poverty gap measures the total amount of money
        necessary to bring all individuals in poverty up to the poverty line. The
        poverty gap per poor person divides this number by the total number of poor
        individuals. A more detailed breakdown according to deciles can be obtained by
        clicking on 'more'.

        <a name='inequality'><h2>Inequality</h2></a>
        <p>

        The Gini coefficient is a measure of the inequality of a distribution, a value
        of 0 expressing total equality and a value of 1 maximal inequality. The Lorenz
        curve is a graphical representation of the distribution of the equivalized
        disposable incomes; it shows for the bottom percentage of individuals, how much
        of total income accrues to them (also in percentage). The closer the Lorenz
        curve is to the 45Â° line, the more equal the Flemish incomes are distributed. A
        more detailed breakdown according to deciles can be obtained by clicking on
